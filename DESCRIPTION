Description: This package takes time series data with multiple quantified pathogen exposures and an infection time and analyzes the dose-response relationship.
                Most simply, given a risk parameter, it can simulate infection times from the data.
                It can fit the risk parameter from the data using two approachs: 1) a survival likelihood approach and 2) fitting to a Kaplan-Meier estimate from the data.
                Outcomes can be plotted (e.g., KM) and evaluated for misclassification.
